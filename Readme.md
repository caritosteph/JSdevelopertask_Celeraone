### CeleraOne Application-Task for JavaScript developers (version 0.3)

The porpose of this task is to generate a table from data.
we would like that the code will be generic as posible, since the data can change.

1. Below are two data output that the server has generated. Fill the table rows with data by JavaScript (you may select one for demonstration purpose).
         * Note that final implementation should be generic and should work on either data examples!
         * the table header will be accourding to the keys (i.e. company_name, fda_code, product ...)

2. Add a event click handler to every <code>th</code> of table so that it will sort rows by value (high to low)     

**DO NOT use any JS libraries like jQuery/underscore.js/Lo-Dash. Your code should be in PURE JavaScript**
